Project #3 Comp 228: Sorted Doubly Link List ADT

This is a group project; groups will be assigned.

Create a sorted list ADT that implements the Unit 3 ListInterface.java, using a doubly linked list as the underlying data structure.

No changes to ListInterface.java are to be made.

A find helper method must be implemented and used in the same manner as the find method in the List ADTs developed in class. The application level must be able to switch the search logic between a sequential search and a binary search. A third option for the search logic may be added.

In addition to the operations specified in ListInterface.java, an iterator class must be developed to allow the logical level to iterate through the data on the list using an enhanced for loop structure. Three types of iteration must be supported:

In order, starting at the beginning of the list
In reverse order, starting at the end of the list
In random order, all items on the list are retrieved exactly one time
Collections.shuffle() cannot be used
The list ADT must include a public facing method that allows the logical level to indicate which type of iteration is to be done the next time an enhanced for loop executes.

A toString() method must also be developed.

Test cases and a test program must also be developed.

At least two test cases for each list operation and the toString, and at least one test case for each type of iteration.
Each test case must explicitly identify the expected output and expected change in the list.
Test program must be consistent with the set of the test cases.
